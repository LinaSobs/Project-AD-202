# ProJECt AD 202 – Student Application System

## 📌 Project Overview
ProJECt AD 202 is a **Windows Forms Application** developed using **C# and .NET Framework**.  
The project allows users to capture and store student information in a **SQL Server database**.

The application provides a simple form where a student’s personal details can be entered and submitted.  
Once submitted, the data is saved directly into a database for future use.

The system allows users to:
- Enter student details such as:
  - Name  
  - Surname  
  - Age  
  - Gender  
  - Address  
  - Course
- Submit the information to a SQL Server database
- Clear the form using a reset button
- Receive confirmation messages after successful submission
- Handle errors if fields are left empty or if a database issue occurs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **Windows Forms**
- **.NET Framework 4.7.2**
- **SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)**
- **ADO.NET (SqlConnection & SqlCommand)**

## 💡 Why This Project Is Useful
- It demonstrates **basic CRUD concepts** (Create operation) using C# and SQL Server
- Helps students understand **database connectivity** using ADO.NET
- Shows how to validate user input in a desktop application
- Can be expanded into a full **student management system**
- Useful for learning **real-world application development**, especially for academic projects

## 🚀 Possible Future Improvements
- Add data viewing (Display students in a table)
- Add update and delete functionality
- Improve error messages
- Add login and user roles
- Use parameter validation for age and gender
- Replace hard-coded connection string with configuration-based settings

## 📚 Educational Value
